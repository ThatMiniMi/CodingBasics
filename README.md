# Coding Cheat Sheets Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of coding cheat sheets.  
It serves as a quick reference for core concepts, syntax, and commands that I’ve learned in class and through practice.  
The goal is to have an organized and easy-to-navigate resource for when I need a recap or encounter a coding block.

## Example Project: Project Dashboard App

To apply the concepts documented in this repository, I am building a **Project Dashboard App**—a full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage projects and tasks with status tracking.

### Technologies used:
- **Frontend:** React + Vite  
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)  
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Tools:** Git, PowerShell, Visual Studio Code  

The source code for this project will either be included in this repository or linked separately. It demonstrates how different parts of the cheat sheets come together in a real-world development workflow.
